# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  User stories help with interpreting user needs by writing what they say into a document that shows what the user wants from a product. This helps with implementing the users thoughts into the program by looking at the user story and breaking down what the user story says into words that make it easy for the development team to understand so that they can work on the code so that the product will receive what the user wants in an update or when the product releases.



# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  One of my approaches when developing programs is by number one, figuring out how long I think the program might take and then using that time to space out what I want to get done in the following days before the due date that is set. One of the agile processes that I would like to incorporate is the user stories because I personally believe that for a product to be efficient and sell well you have to get user advice implemented into your product, I believe this is important because a consumer or user would notice that you're applying what they said into your product which will most likely make them want to continue using that product or buy multiple of your products.



# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  I believe a good team member in software development would never be late to meetings unless they absoloutely needed to, a good team member would also discuss any possible problems that they may be having with the group so that they can get help so that they're no longer stuck on whatever it is they're stuck on. A good team member would also help others around them if they need that help and they would also make sure that everything gets done on time so that nothing is late while they're developing the product, or if something is late they would help solve a workaround so that the product itself is not late.
